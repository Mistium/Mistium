# Hey! I'm Mistium

My Stuff ->

### [originOS]

Origin is by far my biggest project, with a full ui scripting language, network support, port simulation and a multitude of other stuff


### [Mages And Magic]

Mages and Magic is my longest running project but i havent done as much with it recently due to a lack of interest. The game is an mmorpg with all the normal skills and all those sorts of things.

I recently have moved all of the items system into github so when the app boots up, it grabs from github the newest version of items.

I plan to eventually allow anyone to create completely custom worlds and weapons, and place enemies inside of it. All of this synced from github repositories.

This would allow no need to ever update the client except for adding enemy ai types.
